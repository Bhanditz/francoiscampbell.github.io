Welcome to my first Xposed module, DataUsage. This module was born out of the frustration that I had at all the data usage monitoring apps out there that require a pull down on the status bar to see the notification and use their own traffic counting method, causing them to slowly get out of sync with both Android's build-in traffic counter and the carrier's. This project is my work to get around both of these limitations. Follow the link above to the project's website for more information.
